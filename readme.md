# findHopperðŸ¦— 

This is a forked copy of the [xsrp](https://github.com/egrinstein/xsrp) repository. Some of the testing functions from the original libary were removed.

It includes some additional code to do source localization for microphone array recordings of grasshoppers and crickets (see also [thunderhopper](https://github.com/bendalab/thunderhopper) repository).

## Installation

I would recommend installing a [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) virtual environment using the provided `environment.yml` file. This will install all the required dependencies. Change directory to the ```findhopper``` folder and run the following commands:

```
1. conda env create -f environment.yml
2. conda activate findhopper
```
